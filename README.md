# VISD
VISD generally stands for **Veirisimilar Image Synthesis Dataset**, which is proposed and created by @fnzhan in paper: [ECCV'18: Verisimilar image synthesis for accurate detection and recognition of texts in scenes](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Fangneng_Zhan_Verisimilar_Image_Synthesis_ECCV_2018_paper.html). VISD uses semantic segmenation and saliency to locate a semantically sensitive region for texts, which is superior to the SynthText dataset by a large margin when tested on real world datasets.

# CopyRight
The dataset is created and released totally by the original authors. I just collected the download link and related information for followers' using, as searching `VISD` in Google may not direct people to the correct dataset download link, whereas VISD is a commonly cited name in many famous text detection papers.
