# VISD
VISD generally stands for **Veirisimilar Image Synthesis Dataset**, which is proposed and created by @fnzhan in paper: [ECCV'18: Verisimilar image synthesis for accurate detection and recognition of texts in scenes](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Fangneng_Zhan_Verisimilar_Image_Synthesis_ECCV_2018_paper.html). VISD uses semantic segmenation and saliency to locate a semantically sensitive region for texts.
